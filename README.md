# PyGraphX

A super simple Python project to graph math functions using Pygame. Right now,
it plots \( f(x) = x^2 \) on a 2D graph with axes and arrows. It’s a work in
progress, so expect it to be more usable in the future.

## Usage

1. **Make sure you have Python installed.**  
   (If you don’t, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)).

2. **Install Pygame:**  
   Open a terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Download the code:**  
   Clone this repo or download the `main.py` file.

4. **Run the project:**  
   In the terminal, navigate to the folder and run:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play With It

- Change the `f(x)` function in the code to graph something else (e.g., `return x**3`).
- Adjust `graph_x_offset` and `graph_y_offset` to move the graph around.

## Future

Here are some ideas for the future:
- Add zooming and panning.
- Let users input their own functions.
- Add labels to the axes.
